Checkers Everlaw Project
Rajlakshmi De

Run CheckersUI.java to run the game in the console.  Instructions are provided once the program is run.

I ran out of time and did not finish incorporating edge cases in terms of game rules.  For example, a player
should not be allowed to input entries outside of the 0 to 7 range, but I haven't added in a check for this.
I also have not added related checks, such as making sure the player is not selecting to move a piece that does
not belong to her or is not a legal space.  However, I have implemented other checks, such as whether a jump
should have been taken but was not.

If I had more time, I would also refactor my code in a couple of places where there are a few redundancies.
